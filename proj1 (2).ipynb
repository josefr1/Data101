    "* You will need to extract a substring from the `info` column of `movie_info_sample`; you can use the [string functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-string.html) in PostgreSQL to do it. There are many possible solutions. One possible solution is to use the substring function along with regex. If you use this approach, [this section on regex](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP) may be particularly useful. With your chosen approach, ensure that you are returning a single element, and not an array! You may also index into an array. [regex101.com](https://regex101.com) may additionally be helpful in crafting your regular expressions.\n",
    "* You may use `mpaa_rating_id` and `movie_id_2b` directly in the rest of the questions using Python variable substitution (i.e., double curly braces). See the `JupySQL` documentation for more details."

    "- Construct a view named `movie_gross` containing **one row for each movie**, which has `(gross, movie_id, title)`, where `gross` is the numeric dollar amount of the **maximum earnings value** extracted as a float.\n",
    "- To take a look at our cleaned data that we just created in our `movie_gross` view, write a `SELECT` query to display the **top 10 highest grossing films** from `movie_gross`. This query should occur in the same cell and should **ONLY** list your limited top 10 output. Do not use `GROUP BY` or other aggregate functions outside of your view. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:** \n",
    "- The way we extracted the MPAA rating is very similar to how we want to isolate the numeric dollar amount as a string. There are multiple ways of doing this.\n",
    "- Look at the [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/functions-matching.html) for the `regexp_replace` function, and specifically 'flag g'.\n",
    "- Again, as a reminder: we will only be using movies with gross earnings counted in the **USA** and that are in US Dollars (**$**). Ensure that your information string contains both of these markers. The information string contains reported gross earnings as (non-USA) AND (USA), so please check that you are not adding extraneous values. \n",
    "- Be careful when trying to match IDs from one relation to another relation. Take a look at the schema of the relations you are working with, whether in terminal or by referring to the description at the top of the notebook. Ensure both fields reference the same entity. For example, `movie_info_sample.id` does not refer to the same entity as `movie_sample.id`.\n",
    "- Movies may have the same name! You may need to use more than 1 attribute to uniquely identify a movie.\n",
    "- The staff solution found it helpful to make an additional CTE. You may make as many CTEs as you find necessary. Do **not** create views as this may take up significant space in memory. If your kernel is crashing repeatedly, check that you are not creating any views in memory.\n",
